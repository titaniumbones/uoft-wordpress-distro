* University of Toronto Wordpress Distro
This repository is a skeletal framework that holds a group of wordpress cusotmizations, collected in a simple Wordpress plugin and at least one Wordpress theme.  It also contains a simple bash script, init_distro.sh, that will download and unpack both wordpress and a series of plugins, including especially CCTM -- the Custom Content Type Manager plugin -- on which our own plugin and themes rely heavily.
